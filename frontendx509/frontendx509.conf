### Configuration for x509-scitokens-issuer
@INCLUDE x509_scitokens_issuer/x509_scitokens_issuer_http.conf@

# This is the configuration file for the HTTPS web server, listening
# on the port 7368.  It defines the basic SSL server, then includes
# "content" rules from ssl_rewrites.d directory.
#
# The server configuration features are as follows:
#  - Listening on port 7386
#  - Requires SSL, i.e. no HTTP on HTTPS port.  A common exploit is
#    to fool browsers talking in "clear" on a supposedly secure port.
#    Note that this doesn't prevent browsers from revealing secret
#    information at the network level, but does prevent the server
#    from disclosing any information on an unsecure channel, and does
#    prevent the client from completing transactions with the server.
#  - Requires strong authentication; weak encryption is not accepted.
#  - Uses CERN CA signed host keys.  In a load balanced cluster all
#    the hosts share a single key for the DNS alias, not keys for the
#    actual host name (e.g. "cmsweb.cern.ch", rather than "vocmsnn").
#  - CA certificates and CRL lists for all grid sites.  These will be
#    used when SSL client verification is needed, to identify grid
#    certificates.  Certificates from general bodies (Thawte, Verisign
#    and so on) are deliberately not accepted; we only take grid certs.
#  - SSL certificate verification details, where used, are exported
#    to web services hosted on the server, and the back-end proxies.
#  - Try authenticating clients with X509 certificates.  Here the
#    check is merely optional, more complete checks are elsewhere.
#    This has been moved to global server level to avoid issues with
#    re-negotiation triggered by location-specific checks.  This has
#    the unfortunate side effect that accessing the https server, i.e.
#    for almost every access to the server, the client is prompted for
#    a certificate, even if the certificate isn't used for anything.

# Define server virtual host.
# Keep this section last to avoid internal dummy connection issues like
# SSL routines:SSL23_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:unknown protocol -- speaking not SSL to HTTPS port!
